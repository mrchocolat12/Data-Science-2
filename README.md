# Data-Science-2
This is my first project about cleaning data using numpy and pandas.

Target: use the clean_feature.csv dataset and basic convolutional network knowledge to predict the probability of which error will occur in the next two hours (or optional time).

The main topic of this project aims to how to preprocess raw data effectively. Besides, this project also contains a certain knowledge about basic concept of convolutional network for table datasheet.
